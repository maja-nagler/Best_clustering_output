### The repository contains output from an adaptation of clustering method from: 
Best, P., Paris, S., Glotin, H. and Marxer, R., 2023. Deep audio embeddings for vocalisation clustering. Plos one, 18(7), p.e0283396.

### Applied to the Bengalese Finch song data from:
Nicholson, David; Queen, Jonah E.; J. Sober, Samuel (2017): Bengalese Finch song repository. figshare. Dataset. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4805749.v5

### The repository currently contains output of modified versions of the following files from "paper_experiments" folder: 
* plot_clusters.py
* testAE.py
* compute_embeddings.py
* test_AE.py

### Next steps:
Include focusing on generation of input data without the need of annotation.
Hence, working with raw sound data to generate detections .csv file for the purpose of applying the pipeline.
